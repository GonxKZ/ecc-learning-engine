## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure you have ECScope properly built with graphics support:

```bash
# Build ECScope with graphics enabled
cmake -DECSCOPE_ENABLE_GRAPHICS=ON ..
make
```

**Required Dependencies:**
- SDL2 (for window management and input)
- OpenGL 3.3+ (for graphics rendering)
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)

### 2. Building Tutorials

Each tutorial is a standalone executable. Build them individually:

```bash
# From the examples/rendering_tutorials directory
g++ -std=c++20 -I../../include -I../../src \
    01_basic_sprite_rendering.cpp \
    -lecscope -lSDL2 -lGL -lpthread \
    -o tutorial_01_basic_rendering
```

Or use the provided CMake integration (see main CMakeLists.txt).

### 3. Running Tutorials

```bash
./tutorial_01_basic_rendering
./tutorial_02_batching_performance --educational  # Enable detailed explanations
./tutorial_03_advanced_cameras
```

## Interactive Controls

Each tutorial includes interactive controls for hands-on learning:

### Universal Controls (All Tutorials)
- `ESC` or `Q` - Exit tutorial
- `R` - Reset to initial state
- `H` or `F1` - Show help/controls

### Tutorial-Specific Controls
See individual tutorial documentation or press `H` during execution.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Graphics Not Working
```
Error: Graphics support not compiled
Solution: Rebuild ECScope with -DECSCOPE_ENABLE_GRAPHICS=ON
```

### Poor Performance
```
Issue: Low FPS or stuttering
Solutions:
- Run in Release mode (-O2 or -O3)
- Update graphics drivers
- Check GPU compatibility (OpenGL 3.3+ required)
- Reduce sprite count in performance tutorials
```

### SDL2 Not Found
```
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install SDL2-devel
macOS: brew install sdl2
Windows: Download SDL2 development libraries
```

## Advanced Usage

### Modifying Tutorials
The tutorials are designed to be educational and modifiable:

```cpp
// Example: Modify sprite count in Tutorial 2
void create_test_sprites() {
    sprite_count_ = 2000;  // Increase for stress testing
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### Adding Custom Features
Each tutorial provides extension points:

```cpp
// Example: Add custom camera movement in Tutorial 3
void update_custom_camera(f32 delta_time) {
    // Implement your camera logic here
    // This demonstrates extension points
}
```

### Performance Profiling
Use built-in performance tools:

```cpp
// Enable detailed performance tracking
auto config = renderer::Renderer2DConfig::educational_mode();
config.debug.collect_detailed_stats = true;
config.debug.enable_performance_overlay = true;
```

## Integration with ECScope Systems

### Memory System Integration
```cpp
// Monitor memory usage during rendering
auto memory_usage = renderer_->get_memory_usage();
std::cout << "GPU Memory: " << memory_usage.total << " bytes\n";
```

### Physics Integration
```cpp
// Render physics debug information
#ifdef ECSCOPE_HAS_PHYSICS
renderer_->set_debug_rendering_enabled(true);
physics_world.render_debug(*renderer_);
#endif
```

### UI Integration
```cpp
// Add rendering controls to UI
auto rendering_panel = std::make_unique<ui::panels::PanelRenderingDebug>();
ui_overlay_->add_panel("Rendering", std::move(rendering_panel));
```
